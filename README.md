This project involves creating an example portfolio that makes use of the HTML and CSS skills I have learned thus far.  The goal was to create a set of web pages that follow certain prescribed styling rules such as colors, fonts, and sizes for various elements.  One page was to have some brief text about myself along with a picture; another page was to have a set of images with graphic elements over the top of them and to have them arranged in space across the page; and a third page was to have an input field that would simulate a form used to send me a message (the form doesn't go anywhere, it is just a visual element).

Going to the live URL will open the "About Me" page, and there are links in the navigation bar at the top that connect to the other two pages.  In creating this project, I learned to create a navigation bar from scratch and how to make the visual elements on the web page appear exactly where I want them.  This was also the first time I used a pseudo-class (hover) to make the web page react to mousing over some of the elements (the hyperlinks in the navigation bar).

An interesting challenge I came across while working on this project was that when building the site, I used .png images for the "Portfolio" page, and while they worked fine when I opened the site in Chrome from my computer, once I deployed the site and opened it live the images did not load.  The picture of me in the "About Me" page did load, however, and the only difference I could see was that this picture was a .jpg, not a .png, so I tried re-saving the Portfolio images as .jpg's and then they worked on the live website.  So apparently any images I use should be .jpg's, not .png's for whatever reason.

There is one weird bug I have not been able to figure out, and that is on the "About Me" page, sometimes the picture of me is scrunched over like it is being squeezed horizontally.  This does not happen all the time, and often times if you just reload the page it goes back to normal.  I'm not sure what would be causing the code to work one way sometimes and another way other times.
