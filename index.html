                    <p class="about-text">I recently began traveling with my dad to cool places in the United States, many of which have good places to hike.  In the last few years we have gone to the Grand Canyon; Sedona, AZ; Red Rock Canyon, NV; Letchworth State Park, NY; Watkins Glen, NY; Niagara Falls; and the Badlands, SD.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="about-text">In addition to exploring and hiking, I also am a pretty big gamer.  I traditionally have played role-playing games, and right now am playing Final Fantasy 14.  I also started playing Magic: The Gathering about a year ago, and have gravitated toward blue decks.  Any deck that lets me play counterspells is something I'll probably enjoy!</p>
